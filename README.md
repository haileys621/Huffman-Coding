# Huffman-Coding

This program takes a text file, computes frequencies of the characters, and internally builds a Huffman tree. A table of characters is then printed out with the corresponding Huffman codes. The user is then prompted to enter a string of 0's and 1's, which the program decodes based on the Huffman tree. Finally, the user is prompted to enter a string of characters, which the program decodes based on the Huffman tree codes.

The main method of this project is located in Huffman.java.
